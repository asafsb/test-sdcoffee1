## About

Software-Defined Coffee is a personal blog started by me, Asaf Blubshtein. This blog will focus mainly on virtualization and VMware solutions, but also home-labs, certifications, and occasionally - coffee.

My current role is a Product Solutions Architect within the Cloud Infrastructure Business Group at VMware. In this role, I help the development of the VMware Cloud solutions by collaborating with different product teams and technology partners.
